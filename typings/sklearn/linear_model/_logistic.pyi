    """
    Logistic Regression (aka logit, MaxEnt) classifier.

    In the multiclass case, the training algorithm uses the one-vs-rest (OvR)
    scheme if the 'multi_class' option is set to 'ovr', and uses the
    cross-entropy loss if the 'multi_class' option is set to 'multinomial'.
    (Currently the 'multinomial' option is supported only by the 'lbfgs',
    'sag', 'saga' and 'newton-cg' solvers.)

    This class implements regularized logistic regression using the
    'liblinear' library, 'newton-cg', 'sag', 'saga' and 'lbfgs' solvers. **Note
    that regularization is applied by default**. It can handle both dense
    and sparse input. Use C-ordered arrays or CSR matrices containing 64-bit
    floats for optimal performance; any other input format will be converted
    (and copied).

    The 'newton-cg', 'sag', and 'lbfgs' solvers support only L2 regularization
    with primal formulation, or no regularization. The 'liblinear' solver
    supports both L1 and L2 regularization, with a dual formulation only for
    the L2 penalty. The Elastic-Net regularization is only supported by the
    'saga' solver.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <logistic_regression>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    penalty : {'l1', 'l2', 'elasticnet', 'none'}, default='l2'
        Used to specify the norm used in the penalization. The 'newton-cg',
        'sag' and 'lbfgs' solvers support only l2 penalties. 'elasticnet' is
        only supported by the 'saga' solver. If 'none' (not supported by the
        liblinear solver), no regularization is applied.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19
           l1 penalty with SAGA solver (allowing 'multinomial' + L1)

    dual : bool, default=False
        Dual or primal formulation. Dual formulation is only implemented for
        l2 penalty with liblinear solver. Prefer dual=False when
        n_samples > n_features.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        Tolerance for stopping criteria.

    C : float, default=1.0
        Inverse of regularization strength; must be a positive float.
        Like in support vector machines, smaller values specify stronger
        regularization.

    fit_intercept : bool, default=True
        Specifies if a constant (a.k.a. bias or intercept) should be
        added to the decision function.

    intercept_scaling : float, default=1
        Useful only when the solver 'liblinear' is used
        and self.fit_intercept is set to True. In this case, x becomes
        [x, self.intercept_scaling],
        i.e. a "synthetic" feature with constant value equal to
        intercept_scaling is appended to the instance vector.
        The intercept becomes ``intercept_scaling * synthetic_feature_weight``.

        Note! the synthetic feature weight is subject to l1/l2 regularization
        as all other features.
        To lessen the effect of regularization on synthetic feature weight
        (and therefore on the intercept) intercept_scaling has to be increased.

    class_weight : dict or 'balanced', default=None
        Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
        If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one.

        The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``.

        Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed
        through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           *class_weight='balanced'*

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None
        Used when ``solver`` == 'sag', 'saga' or 'liblinear' to shuffle the
        data. See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

    solver : {'newton-cg', 'lbfgs', 'liblinear', 'sag', 'saga'}, \
            default='lbfgs'

        Algorithm to use in the optimization problem.

        - For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag' and
          'saga' are faster for large ones.
        - For multiclass problems, only 'newton-cg', 'sag', 'saga' and 'lbfgs'
          handle multinomial loss; 'liblinear' is limited to one-versus-rest
          schemes.
        - 'newton-cg', 'lbfgs', 'sag' and 'saga' handle L2 or no penalty
        - 'liblinear' and 'saga' also handle L1 penalty
        - 'saga' also supports 'elasticnet' penalty
        - 'liblinear' does not support setting ``penalty='none'``

        Note that 'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on
        features with approximately the same scale. You can
        preprocess the data with a scaler from sklearn.preprocessing.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver.
        .. versionadded:: 0.19
           SAGA solver.
        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
            The default solver changed from 'liblinear' to 'lbfgs' in 0.22.

    max_iter : int, default=100
        Maximum number of iterations taken for the solvers to converge.

    multi_class : {'auto', 'ovr', 'multinomial'}, default='auto'
        If the option chosen is 'ovr', then a binary problem is fit for each
        label. For 'multinomial' the loss minimised is the multinomial loss fit
        across the entire probability distribution, *even when the data is
        binary*. 'multinomial' is unavailable when solver='liblinear'.
        'auto' selects 'ovr' if the data is binary, or if solver='liblinear',
        and otherwise selects 'multinomial'.

        .. versionadded:: 0.18
           Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver for 'multinomial' case.
        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
            Default changed from 'ovr' to 'auto' in 0.22.

    verbose : int, default=0
        For the liblinear and lbfgs solvers set verbose to any positive
        number for verbosity.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as
        initialization, otherwise, just erase the previous solution.
        Useless for liblinear solver. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           *warm_start* to support *lbfgs*, *newton-cg*, *sag*, *saga* solvers.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        Number of CPU cores used when parallelizing over classes if
        multi_class='ovr'". This parameter is ignored when the ``solver`` is
        set to 'liblinear' regardless of whether 'multi_class' is specified or
        not. ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend`
        context. ``-1`` means using all processors.
        See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>` for more details.

    l1_ratio : float, default=None
        The Elastic-Net mixing parameter, with ``0 <= l1_ratio <= 1``. Only
        used if ``penalty='elasticnet'``. Setting ``l1_ratio=0`` is equivalent
        to using ``penalty='l2'``, while setting ``l1_ratio=1`` is equivalent
        to using ``penalty='l1'``. For ``0 < l1_ratio <1``, the penalty is a
        combination of L1 and L2.

    Attributes
    ----------

    classes_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes, )
        A list of class labels known to the classifier.

    coef_ : ndarray of shape (1, n_features) or (n_classes, n_features)
        Coefficient of the features in the decision function.

        `coef_` is of shape (1, n_features) when the given problem is binary.
        In particular, when `multi_class='multinomial'`, `coef_` corresponds
        to outcome 1 (True) and `-coef_` corresponds to outcome 0 (False).

    intercept_ : ndarray of shape (1,) or (n_classes,)
        Intercept (a.k.a. bias) added to the decision function.

        If `fit_intercept` is set to False, the intercept is set to zero.
        `intercept_` is of shape (1,) when the given problem is binary.
        In particular, when `multi_class='multinomial'`, `intercept_`
        corresponds to outcome 1 (True) and `-intercept_` corresponds to
        outcome 0 (False).

    n_iter_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,) or (1, )
        Actual number of iterations for all classes. If binary or multinomial,
        it returns only 1 element. For liblinear solver, only the maximum
        number of iteration across all classes is given.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.20

            In SciPy <= 1.0.0 the number of lbfgs iterations may exceed
            ``max_iter``. ``n_iter_`` will now report at most ``max_iter``.

    Notes
    -----
    The underlying C implementation uses a random number generator to
    select features when fitting the model. It is thus not uncommon,
    to have slightly different results for the same input data. If
    that happens, try with a smaller tol parameter.

    Predict output may not match that of standalone liblinear in certain
    cases. See :ref:`differences from liblinear <liblinear_differences>`
    in the narrative documentation.

class LogisticRegressionCV(LogisticRegression, LinearClassifierMixin, BaseEstimator):
    """Logistic Regression CV (aka logit, MaxEnt) classifier.

    See glossary entry for :term:`cross-validation estimator`.

    This class implements logistic regression using liblinear, newton-cg, sag
    of lbfgs optimizer. The newton-cg, sag and lbfgs solvers support only L2
    regularization with primal formulation. The liblinear solver supports both
    L1 and L2 regularization, with a dual formulation only for the L2 penalty.
    Elastic-Net penalty is only supported by the saga solver.

    For the grid of `Cs` values and `l1_ratios` values, the best hyperparameter
    is selected by the cross-validator
    :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold`, but it can be changed
    using the :term:`cv` parameter. The 'newton-cg', 'sag', 'saga' and 'lbfgs'
    solvers can warm-start the coefficients (see :term:`Glossary<warm_start>`).

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <logistic_regression>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Cs : int or list of floats, default=10
        Each of the values in Cs describes the inverse of regularization
        strength. If Cs is as an int, then a grid of Cs values are chosen
        in a logarithmic scale between 1e-4 and 1e4.
        Like in support vector machines, smaller values specify stronger
        regularization.

    fit_intercept : bool, default=True
        Specifies if a constant (a.k.a. bias or intercept) should be
        added to the decision function.

    cv : int or cross-validation generator, default=None
        The default cross-validation generator used is Stratified K-Folds.
        If an integer is provided, then it is the number of folds used.
        See the module :mod:`sklearn.model_selection` module for the
        list of possible cross-validation objects.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
            ``cv`` default value if None changed from 3-fold to 5-fold.

    dual : bool, default=False
        Dual or primal formulation. Dual formulation is only implemented for
        l2 penalty with liblinear solver. Prefer dual=False when
        n_samples > n_features.

    penalty : {'l1', 'l2', 'elasticnet'}, default='l2'
        Used to specify the norm used in the penalization. The 'newton-cg',
        'sag' and 'lbfgs' solvers support only l2 penalties. 'elasticnet' is
        only supported by the 'saga' solver.

    scoring : str or callable, default=None
        A string (see model evaluation documentation) or
        a scorer callable object / function with signature
        ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``. For a list of scoring functions
        that can be used, look at :mod:`sklearn.metrics`. The
        default scoring option used is 'accuracy'.

    solver : {'newton-cg', 'lbfgs', 'liblinear', 'sag', 'saga'}, \
            default='lbfgs'

        Algorithm to use in the optimization problem.

        - For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag' and
          'saga' are faster for large ones.
        - For multiclass problems, only 'newton-cg', 'sag', 'saga' and 'lbfgs'
          handle multinomial loss; 'liblinear' is limited to one-versus-rest
          schemes.
        - 'newton-cg', 'lbfgs' and 'sag' only handle L2 penalty, whereas
          'liblinear' and 'saga' handle L1 penalty.
        - 'liblinear' might be slower in LogisticRegressionCV because it does
          not handle warm-starting.

        Note that 'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on
        features with approximately the same scale. You can preprocess the data
        with a scaler from sklearn.preprocessing.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver.
        .. versionadded:: 0.19
           SAGA solver.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        Tolerance for stopping criteria.

    max_iter : int, default=100
        Maximum number of iterations of the optimization algorithm.

    class_weight : dict or 'balanced', default=None
        Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
        If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one.

        The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``.

        Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed
        through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           class_weight == 'balanced'

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        Number of CPU cores used during the cross-validation loop.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    verbose : int, default=0
        For the 'liblinear', 'sag' and 'lbfgs' solvers set verbose to any
        positive number for verbosity.

    refit : bool, default=True
        If set to True, the scores are averaged across all folds, and the
        coefs and the C that corresponds to the best score is taken, and a
        final refit is done using these parameters.
        Otherwise the coefs, intercepts and C that correspond to the
        best scores across folds are averaged.

    intercept_scaling : float, default=1
        Useful only when the solver 'liblinear' is used
        and self.fit_intercept is set to True. In this case, x becomes
        [x, self.intercept_scaling],
        i.e. a "synthetic" feature with constant value equal to
        intercept_scaling is appended to the instance vector.
        The intercept becomes ``intercept_scaling * synthetic_feature_weight``.

        Note! the synthetic feature weight is subject to l1/l2 regularization
        as all other features.
        To lessen the effect of regularization on synthetic feature weight
        (and therefore on the intercept) intercept_scaling has to be increased.

    multi_class : {'auto, 'ovr', 'multinomial'}, default='auto'
        If the option chosen is 'ovr', then a binary problem is fit for each
        label. For 'multinomial' the loss minimised is the multinomial loss fit
        across the entire probability distribution, *even when the data is
        binary*. 'multinomial' is unavailable when solver='liblinear'.
        'auto' selects 'ovr' if the data is binary, or if solver='liblinear',
        and otherwise selects 'multinomial'.

        .. versionadded:: 0.18
           Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver for 'multinomial' case.
        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
            Default changed from 'ovr' to 'auto' in 0.22.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None
        Used when `solver='sag'`, 'saga' or 'liblinear' to shuffle the data.
        Note that this only applies to the solver and not the cross-validation
        generator. See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

    l1_ratios : list of float, default=None
        The list of Elastic-Net mixing parameter, with ``0 <= l1_ratio <= 1``.
        Only used if ``penalty='elasticnet'``. A value of 0 is equivalent to
        using ``penalty='l2'``, while 1 is equivalent to using
        ``penalty='l1'``. For ``0 < l1_ratio <1``, the penalty is a combination
        of L1 and L2.

    Attributes
    ----------
    classes_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes, )
        A list of class labels known to the classifier.

    coef_ : ndarray of shape (1, n_features) or (n_classes, n_features)
        Coefficient of the features in the decision function.

        `coef_` is of shape (1, n_features) when the given problem
        is binary.

    intercept_ : ndarray of shape (1,) or (n_classes,)
        Intercept (a.k.a. bias) added to the decision function.

        If `fit_intercept` is set to False, the intercept is set to zero.
        `intercept_` is of shape(1,) when the problem is binary.

    Cs_ : ndarray of shape (n_cs)
        Array of C i.e. inverse of regularization parameter values used
        for cross-validation.

    l1_ratios_ : ndarray of shape (n_l1_ratios)
        Array of l1_ratios used for cross-validation. If no l1_ratio is used
        (i.e. penalty is not 'elasticnet'), this is set to ``[None]``

    coefs_paths_ : ndarray of shape (n_folds, n_cs, n_features) or \
                   (n_folds, n_cs, n_features + 1)
        dict with classes as the keys, and the path of coefficients obtained
        during cross-validating across each fold and then across each Cs
        after doing an OvR for the corresponding class as values.
        If the 'multi_class' option is set to 'multinomial', then
        the coefs_paths are the coefficients corresponding to each class.
        Each dict value has shape ``(n_folds, n_cs, n_features)`` or
        ``(n_folds, n_cs, n_features + 1)`` depending on whether the
        intercept is fit or not. If ``penalty='elasticnet'``, the shape is
        ``(n_folds, n_cs, n_l1_ratios_, n_features)`` or
        ``(n_folds, n_cs, n_l1_ratios_, n_features + 1)``.

    scores_ : dict
        dict with classes as the keys, and the values as the
        grid of scores obtained during cross-validating each fold, after doing
        an OvR for the corresponding class. If the 'multi_class' option
        given is 'multinomial' then the same scores are repeated across
        all classes, since this is the multinomial class. Each dict value
        has shape ``(n_folds, n_cs`` or ``(n_folds, n_cs, n_l1_ratios)`` if
        ``penalty='elasticnet'``.

    C_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,) or (n_classes - 1,)
        Array of C that maps to the best scores across every class. If refit is
        set to False, then for each class, the best C is the average of the
        C's that correspond to the best scores for each fold.
        `C_` is of shape(n_classes,) when the problem is binary.

    l1_ratio_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,) or (n_classes - 1,)
        Array of l1_ratio that maps to the best scores across every class. If
        refit is set to False, then for each class, the best l1_ratio is the
        average of the l1_ratio's that correspond to the best scores for each
        fold.  `l1_ratio_` is of shape(n_classes,) when the problem is binary.

    n_iter_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes, n_folds, n_cs) or (1, n_folds, n_cs)
        Actual number of iterations for all classes, folds and Cs.
        In the binary or multinomial cases, the first dimension is equal to 1.
        If ``penalty='elasticnet'``, the shape is ``(n_classes, n_folds,
        n_cs, n_l1_ratios)`` or ``(1, n_folds, n_cs, n_l1_ratios)``.
